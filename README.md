# React-Final-Project
My final project for my React class! It's silly website that pretends to sell space land.


*NOTE* if you wish to run and check this website out you will need to reinstall node_modules using the *npm install react* command. Also, you'll need to run the *json-server --watch listings.json --port 3001* in the servers/ directory on a seperate terminal to run the server.
